    <br>
    <p>Dear Gloria,</p>
    <br>
    <p>As we gather here under the golden hues of autumn to celebrate your 20th birthday, we are reminded of the beautiful symphony that is your life. Each year is a new movement, filled with its own unique melodies and harmonies.</p>

    <p>Your love for music is infectious. It's as if each note you play on your violin resonates within our hearts. And who could forget your culinary adventures? Each dish is like a new composition, filled with exciting flavors and textures.</p>

    <p>Watching you play the violin is like witnessing a virtuoso at work, even if it's only once. The sweet melodies you create are a testament to your talent and passion.</p>

    <p>Reconnecting with you has been like discovering a long-lost piece of music, movies, series and most important, friendship. Our shared interests in horror movies and our mutual bouts of laziness have added a touch of humor to our lives. And let's not
        forget our playful speculations about your supposed psychic abilities!</p>

    <p>But beneath all the jokes and laughter lies a serious ambition. We, no I have no doubt that you will excel in your chosen field of psychology. Who knows? You might even uncover the secret psychology behind musicians who write songs about laziness!</p>

    <p>So here's to another year of beautiful music, delicious food, shared laughter, and new adventures. Happy birthday, Gloria!</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p><i>Your forever out-of-tune but in perfect harmony friend</i></p>
    <p><i>Me, Myself and I</i></p>
